Mountains and more mountains

#### DESCRIPTION
This loop puts the challenge in the Julian Bikepack Challenge! The loop begins with a descent from Julian to Banner, where you will start a climb over to [Cuyamaca Rancho State Park](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=667) for some great singletrack. The singletrack will have you working your way over to Mount Laguna via Indian Creek Trail, which is sure to test your climbing ability. Then the incredible singletrack playground of Mount Laguna awaits you before you are sent down to Pine Valley on one of the most epic singletrack runs in the country namely Noble Canyon. From Pine Valley we take in the [Corral Canyon OHV Area](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detailfull/cleveland/recreation/ohv/?cid=stelprdb5277278&width=full) dirt and singletrack for a 50 mile loop that ends back in Pine Valley. From Pine Valley itâ€™s back to Julian with a sweet mix of chipseal, dirt road, singletrack and the the final paved cruise back to town.

#### DIFFICULTY
This loop is the most technical of the three loops, with several rocky descents and ascents, and some serious elevation gain. A full suspension bike will be ideal on this loop.

#### RESUPPLY
Resupply at Lake Cuyamaca (1mi off course), Mount Laguna or in Pine Valley. There are restaurants at all three resupply points.

#### CAMPING/LODGING
Camping in Cuyamaca Rancho State Park at Green Valley, Granite Springs Primitive, Laguna, Burnt Rancheria and Bobcat Meadow campgrounds. The only hotel options are at the Laguna Mountain Lodge and the Pine Valley Inn in Pine Valley.

#### WEATHER
Ideal time to do this loop is in the fall or spring. In the winter the higher elevations may have snow. In the summer it can get hot at the lower elevations.

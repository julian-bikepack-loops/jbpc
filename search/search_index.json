This means the entire 4.5 mile section has to be bypassed by continuing south on Pamo Rd, to West Haverdford Rd onto SR78 heading west to rejoin the route. This highway can carry a lot of traffic at times, so be cautious.  There have been reports that the old Banner Toll Road heading up into Julian (around mile 120 on BFL) is overgrown and torn up, for now stick to the asphalt up Banner Grade then use Wynola &amp; Farmer Rd into Julian."},{"location":"about/","title":"About","text":"<p>The Julian Bikepack Challenge was originally created as a 3 loop bikepacking route to highlight the incredibly diverse terrain and scenery around San Diego County.

Do not underestimate how difficult it is to ride a fully loaded bike on dirt and gravel roads. Be realistic with how much distance you can cover taking the elevation gain into account when planning your resupply stops and lodging.</p> <p>We highly recomend getting a Spot Tracker if you are frequent bikepacker. One of the devices can save your life when you get into trouble.</p>"},{"location":"info/#navigation","title":"NAVIGATION","text":"<p>We highly recommend using a GPS device to navigate. For each loop we provide GPX route files on the Downloads page.  Some loops can easily be done without a GPS if you have good maps and competent skills. Other loops involve difficult route finding and we note when a GPS is highly recommended.  Obviously you can ride all of these routes without one, but following the GPS tracks will in most cases save you the time spent messing around trying to figure out the right way to go.</p> <p>While the standard Garmin Edge devices will work, you are following a line on the screen and battery life is generally poor. A GPS device with an interactive map works better for bikepacking. Hiking devices like the Garmin eTrex models work very well and as a bonus can be run of AA batteries or a USB battery pack. Cell phone coverage is generally poor/non-existent in the remote areas, so do not rely solely on a cell phone for navigation and emergencies.</p>"},{"location":"info/#bike-tire-selection","title":"BIKE &amp; TIRE SELECTION","text":"<p>There is no specific bike recommendation for the challenge.

Having said that, you can use whatever you have, whether it's rigid or full-suspension.</p> <p>The same can be said for tire selection. There are some rocky sections on the loops, therefore tires with tough sidewalls are recommended. The Desert Loop will have a lot of cactus, so a tubeless conversion is HIGHLY recommended.
